# Frapapa Betting Scraper

The **Frapapa Betting Scraper** automates the process of extracting betting data from the Frapapa platform. This script collects information on upcoming football matches, including odds for the home team, away team, and draw, then outputs the data into a CSV file for analysis.

## üìå Features

- **Automated Scraping**: Extracts live betting data from Frapapa's upcoming football matches.
- **Efficient Page Interaction**: Automatically navigates to the Frapapa site and clicks on the "Upcoming" section to load matches.
- **Data Output**: Saves all relevant data, such as team names, odds, and match time, into a CSV file.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensures no duplicate match entries exist in the output file.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script uses Selenium to initialize a browser and navigates to Frapapa's website.
2. **Web Page Interaction**: It waits for the "Upcoming" button to become clickable and clicks it to view upcoming matches.
3. **Data Extraction**: The script extracts match information such as time, home team, away team, and odds.
4. **CSV Output**: The extracted data is saved in a CSV file located at the specified path.

### Key Components:

- **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium for interacting with the website and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes the scraped data into a dictionary format for easier saving.
- **CSV File Management**: Manages the creation, updating, and deduplication of CSV files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before running the script, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **BeautifulSoup**
- **Pandas**

Install the required libraries via pip:
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   ```bash

   ```

4. **View Results**:

## üìÅ Output

The output CSV file will include the following columns:
- **TIME**: The time of the match.
- **HOME TEAM**: The name of the home team.
- **AWAY TEAM**: The name of the away team.

- **DRAW ODD**: Odds for a draw.
